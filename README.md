# Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project compares the efficiency and scalability of Randomized Quicksort and Hash Table with Chaining.

## Files
- `Heapsort.py`: Implementation of the Heapsort algorithm.
- `PriorityQueue.py`: Implementation of the priority queue and task scheduler.
- `Report.md`: Theoretical and empirical analysis.
- `README.md`: Instructions to run the code and summary of findings.
- `Images`: Images attached for the Report

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository and run the python files `Heapsort.py` and `PriorityQueue.py`

## Summary of Findings:
Please go to `Report.md` for the report of my findings
